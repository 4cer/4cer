I'm best summed up as a wannabe game developer and artist, studying ICT System development. From the latter side of things, worked mostly with Java and C#, had contact with C/C++, PHP, Perl, SQL, CSS, HTML.
On the game side of things, had some experiences making quick mock-ups and demos in Unity, then moved onto Unreal Engine 4, where I've yet to produce anything amazing. Also co-developped a game engine and a simple game based on it, along with the assets.
- I'm looking to collaborate on things game/game-engine-related
- I’m currently studying ICT at the Military University of Technology in Warsaw
- You can reach me via email in bio
